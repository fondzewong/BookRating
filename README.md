**Book Rating Prediction Model**

**Project Overview**

In a world brimming with books, selecting the best reads can be daunting. Utilizing a dataset curated from Goodreads, encompassing real user ratings and reviews, this project aims to simplify that choice. Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting a book's rating, thereby guiding readers toward highly regarded titles.

**Introduction**
This project leverages Python and several machine learning libraries to predict the rating of books based on various attributes sourced from Goodreads. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following attributes for each book:
    •	bookID: Unique identification number
    •	title: Book title
    •	authors: Names of authors (delimited by “/” for multiple authors)
    •	average_rating: The book's average rating
    •	isbn: International Standard Book Number
    •	isbn13: 13-digit ISBN
    •	language_code: Primary language of the book
    •	num_pages: Number of pages
    •	ratings_count: Total number of ratings
    •	text_reviews_count: Total number of text reviews
    •	publication_date: Publication date
    •	publisher: Book publisher

**Project Objectives**
    •	Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.
    •	Perform feature engineering to create new variables that could enhance model performance.
    •	Train a model to predict a book’s average rating.
    •	Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.
    •	Deploy the model for future predictions.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**
    •	Python 3.8 or later
    •	pip for installing Python packages

**Installation**

**Clone the repository to your local machine:**
git clone https://github.com/fondzewong/BookRating.git 

**Navigate to the project directory:**
cd BookRating 

**Install the required packages:**
pip install -r requirements.txt 


**Usage**
To run the project, execute the Jupyter Notebook Book_Rating_Prediction_Model.ipynb:
jupyter notebook Book_Rating_Prediction_Model.ipynb 

**Project Structure**
•	Book_Rating_Prediction_Model.ipynb: Main project notebook containing the analysis, model training, and evaluation.
•	requirements.txt: List of packages required to run the project.
•	data/: Directory containing the dataset file Books.csv.
•	models/: Saved models and their performance metrics.
•	README.md: Project description and setup instructions.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
We perform an initial analysis to understand the data's distribution, identify missing values, and visualize the relationships between different features.

**Feature Engineering and Selection**
Based on the exploratory analysis, we engineer new features that could improve the model's predictive power and select the most relevant features for training.

**Model Training and Evaluation**
We experiment with various regression models, including RandomForestRegressor and LinearRegression, to predict the average book rating. The models are evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

**Deployment**
Instructions for deploying the model using Flask/Docker or any cloud service (AWS, Heroku) are included in the deployment/ directory.
